# Who Wants to Be a Millionaire Game


Who wants to Be an AltarServer Game was developed for St Brendan's Parish on a voluntary basis to allow a game with all the children to particpate.

The game allowed for all of the children to play one after the other with a scoreboard at the end of the game.

The Music and images were extracted from the Offical Who Wants to be a Millionaire game at the time


As the copyright for the WHo Wants to be a Millionaire game is owned by Sony Pictures Television, eventhough I have written the code, it cannot be sold or distributed.

The Game worked on WIndows XP in 2010  but requires furter work to patch for higher Windows version and to improve the old Swing GUI interface
